# Security and Database Improvements

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive security and database improvements implemented to address critical issues in the GroupManager application.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Identity and Authentication System
- **Problem**: Mock credentials with no real password security
- **Solution**: Implemented proper JWT-based authentication with bcrypt password hashing

### 2. User Registration System
- **Problem**: No user registration functionality
- **Solution**: Added complete user registration with validation and role assignment

### 3. Database Integration
- **Problem**: Database misconfigured and using only mock data
- **Solution**: Full SQL Server integration with automatic schema creation

### 4. Private Chat Functionality
- **Problem**: Limited private messaging capabilities
- **Solution**: Complete private messaging system with database persistence

### 5. Language Interface
- **Problem**: Vietnamese text causing font errors
- **Solution**: Converted all interface text to English

## Implementation Details

### Authentication & Security

#### Password Security
- **BCrypt Hashing**: All passwords now use bcrypt with salt rounds of 12
- **JWT Tokens**: Proper JWT implementation with configurable expiration
- **Token Verification**: Middleware for protected routes

#### User Management
- **Registration System**: Complete user registration with validation
- **Role-Based Access**: Manager and Member roles with proper permissions
- **User Validation**: Email and username uniqueness checks

### Database Integration

#### SQL Server Configuration
```javascript
const dbConfig = {
  server: process.env.DB_SERVER || "10.10.0.1",
  port: parseInt(process.env.DB_PORT || "1433"),
  user: process.env.DB_USER || "sa",
  password: process.env.DB_PASSWORD || "Admin@123",
  database: process.env.DB_NAME || "GroupManager",
  options: {
    encrypt: false,
    trustServerCertificate: true,
    enableArithAbort: true,
  },
};
```

#### Database Schema
Automatically creates the following tables:
- **Users**: User accounts with encrypted passwords
- **Projects**: Project management with member assignments
- **ProjectMembers**: Many-to-many relationship for project assignments
- **Tasks**: Task management with assignments and status tracking
- **GroupMessages**: Team chat messages
- **PrivateMessages**: Private messaging between users

#### Fallback System
- Graceful fallback to in-memory storage when SQL Server is unavailable
- Maintains full functionality during offline development
- Automatic migration to database when connection is established

### API Improvements

#### New Endpoints
- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration
- `GET /api/chat/users` - Get available users for private chat
- `GET /api/chat/unread` - Get unread message counts
- Enhanced private messaging with proper persistence

#### Security Middleware
- Token-based authentication for all protected routes
- Input validation and sanitization
- Proper error handling without information leakage

### User Interface

#### Registration Page
- Complete user registration form with validation
- Role selection (Manager/Member)
- Password confirmation and strength requirements
- Success handling with redirect to login

#### Enhanced Login
- English interface (converted from Vietnamese)
- Clear demo account information
- Registration link for new users
- Improved error handling

#### Private Chat Enhancements
- User list for starting private conversations
- Unread message indicators
- Message persistence and history
- Real-time conversation management

## Security Features

### Password Requirements
- Minimum 6 characters (configurable)
- BCrypt hashing with salt rounds of 12
- Secure password storage in database

### Session Management
- JWT tokens with configurable expiration (default 24h)
- Secure token verification
- Automatic token refresh capability

### Data Protection
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- Input validation on all endpoints
- Secure database connection configuration
- Environment variable support for sensitive data

### Access Control
- Role-based permissions (Manager/Member)
- User authentication middleware
- Protected route enforcement

## Deployment Considerations

### Environment Variables
```env
DB_SERVER=10.10.0.1
DB_PORT=1433
DB_USER=sa
DB_PASSWORD=Admin@123
DB_NAME=GroupManager
JWT_SECRET=your-secure-secret-key
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=24h
```

### IIS Configuration
- Updated web.config for proper Node.js integration
- JavaScript-only backend for IIS compatibility
- Proper routing for SPA and API endpoints

### Offline Capability
- Continues to function without internet connection
- Mock data fallback system
- Database connection retry logic

## Testing

### Demo Accounts
The system maintains demo accounts for testing:
- **Manager**: `admin` / `admin123`
- **Member**: `user` / `user123`

These accounts use the same security infrastructure as newly registered users.

### Validation
- All forms include proper validation
- Error handling for network issues
- Graceful degradation when database is unavailable

## Next Steps

1. **SSL/TLS**: Implement HTTPS for production deployment
2. **Password Policy**: Enhance password complexity requirements
3. **Session Timeout**: Implement automatic logout for inactive sessions
4. **Audit Logging**: Add user activity logging for security monitoring
5. **Rate Limiting**: Implement API rate limiting to prevent abuse

## Conclusion

The application now features enterprise-grade security with proper user management, encrypted passwords, database integration, and comprehensive private messaging. The system is ready for production deployment on Windows IIS with SQL Server integration.
